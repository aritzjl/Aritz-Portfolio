# ⚡ OpenAI vs Groq: the simple switch that cuts your AI costs by up to 10x

## Introduction
Published on November 15, 2025, the video explains how many automations are paying ten times more than necessary by calling GPT-4 or GPT-5 for tasks that are simply summaries, classifications or extractions. The core message is: align the task with the right model before hitting the priciest endpoint.

## Why most tasks don't need GPT-4
GPT-4o and GPT-5 are incredible, but also expensive and slower when your problem just needs structured output or a straightforward classification. That mismatch between the task and the model is where the cost explosion happens. Measure the required intelligence before choosing the premium API.

## Groq: running open source models with better cost/performance
Groq is the alternative provider that executes open-source models like Llama 3.3 (70B) or Qwen with lower latency and significantly lower price than OpenAI. You can bring your own weights and keep your current pipeline mostly untouched. The video walks through how Groq delivers a performance close to GPT-4o while consuming far fewer tokens and charging a fraction of the price.

## Real comparison: GPT-4o vs Llama 3.3 on Groq
The same task is executed against GPT-4o and against Llama 3.3 running on Groq. Cost, speed and output quality are compared side by side. The lesson is that Groq is not only cheaper—it gives you so much budget back that you can iterate more or add extra steps to the pipeline without breaking the bank.

## When to choose each provider
- Use OpenAI when you need GPT-4o’s multimodal strengths, specific features or a prompt that already works well with OpenAI’s models.  
- Switch to Groq when an open source model delivers enough quality and you want to optimize cost without rewriting everything.  
- Combine both: let Groq handle the bulk of the flow and reserve OpenAI for the mission-critical stages that demand its extra precision.

## Closing
If you build automations, SaaS products, or any solution that depends on AI APIs, start modeling when to use Groq and when to call OpenAI—this simple change can shrink your bill by an order of magnitude without hurting user experience.
