# üß© PDF Parse: how to prepare documents so an AI can understand them

## Introduction
When we talk about AI, we usually think about powerful models, embeddings and complex architectures. But there is a prior, quiet and absolutely critical step: giving it good information. And most of that information comes as PDF documents or images.

The problem is that AI models cannot see or read those files directly. First, someone needs to translate the content into a structured format they can understand. That process is called document parsing, and it is far more important (and complex) than it seems.

## The challenge: extract structure, not just text
Pulling raw text from a PDF is easy. The hard part is keeping the semantic structure of the document:

- where a table starts and ends,
- which text belongs to a heading,
- how paragraphs relate to each other,
- which images go with which sections.

A simple text extractor can return thousands of lines without context. If you feed that to an LLM, the result will be‚Ä¶ confusion.

## Three solutions to turn PDFs into knowledge
To solve this, several libraries can transform documents into structured data. I‚Äôve tried three standout options:

### üß† 1. Unstructured
One of the most mature and widely used options. It can process many file types (PDF, DOCX, HTML, emails, images, etc.) and convert them into structured elements. Great for quick pipelines or environments where speed and simplicity matter.

Weakness: results can lose accuracy for large PDFs or documents with heavy visual formatting.

### üëÅÔ∏è 2. Docling
A more recent solution driven by the Hugging Face community. It leverages multimodal models (vision + language) to understand the visual hierarchy of documents. It works especially well for reports, invoices or scientific papers with tables and charts.

Note: it requires more resources and its API is still evolving.

### üß© 3. LlamaParse
The most advanced of the group. Part of the LlamaIndex ecosystem, it uses LLMs to reconstruct the document structure with real semantic understanding. It can understand content and return perfectly structured JSON or Markdown.

Downside: it‚Äôs a paid solution and cloud‚Äëbased.

## Quick comparison

| Library      | Accuracy | Speed | Cost   | Best for                            |
|--------------|----------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Unstructured | ‚≠ê‚≠ê       | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê  | Free   | Simple pipelines / basic RAG        |
| Docling      | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê     | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | Free   | Complex / highly visual documents   |
| LlamaParse   | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê    | ‚≠ê‚≠ê    | Paid   | Semantic parsing with an LLM        |

## Conclusion
There is no perfect tool. It depends on what you need:

- If you want something fast and free, start with Unstructured.
- If your documents have complex visual structure, try Docling.
- If you need semantic precision and pristine formatting, LlamaParse plays in another league.

In my case, I often combine several depending on the project:
- üß© Unstructured for OCR,
- üëÅÔ∏è Docling for visual structure,
- üß† LlamaParse for semantics and context.

## See it in action
I recently published a YouTube video that shows all three in action: how they process the same document, what they return, and where each one fails.

## Closing
The quality of an AI system depends as much on its data as it does on its models. With documents, understanding structure is just as important as understanding content.
