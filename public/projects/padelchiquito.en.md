# PadelChiquito ‚Äî Smart padel racket comparator

**PadelChiquito** is a web platform that centralizes padel racket catalogs from different brands and stores so players can compare, review and find the best racket for their level, playing style and budget.

üîó **Site:** [https://padelchiquito.com](https://padelchiquito.com)

## Goal
Help players and coaches make informed buying decisions by comparing models using real technical criteria (shape, balance, weight, feel) ‚Äî not just price. At the same time, offer stores a transparent, automated visibility and affiliation channel.

- Available reviews are scattered and poorly standardized.  
- Price fluctuations make it hard to spot good purchase opportunities.  

**PadelChiquito** solves this by centralizing catalog, reviews and up‚Äëto‚Äëdate prices in a single interface.

## Main features
- üîç **Racket search and comparison** with advanced filters by level, brand, shape, balance or stiffness.
